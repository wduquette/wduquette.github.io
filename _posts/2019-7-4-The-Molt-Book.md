title: The Molt Book
---

[_The Molt Book_](https://wduquette.github.io/molt) is now on-line.  The Book is (in
proper Rust fashion) the user's guide for [Molt](https://github.com/wduquette/molt) and its
related crates.  It describes both the Molt command-line tools and the language itself,
including all differences from [Standard Tcl](https://www.tcl-lang.org).  

Like Molt, The Book is a work in progress.  If you find any problems, the
[**mdbook**](https://crates.io/crates/mdbook) source is in the [Molt repo](https://github.com/wduquette/molt); go ahead and write me an issue.
