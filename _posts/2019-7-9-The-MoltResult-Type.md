title: The MoltResult Type
---

Rust provides the standard `Result<T,E>` type for returning values from functions or methods
that might need to include error info or the like.  C has no such thing; and so the C
implementation of Tcl has to jump through some hoops.  I'm going to describe how Standard Tcl
does it, and then how I've implemented the same pattern in Rust.

## How Tcl's C API Handles Results

In standard Tcl's C API, functions that might affect the flow of control return a _result code_:
an integer that indicates what happened.  The set of C functions cooperate to make the flow of
control indicated by the user's code actually happen.

There are five standard return codes:

* `TCL_OK`
* `TCL_ERROR`
* `TCL_BREAK`
* `TCL_CONTINUE`
* `TCL_RETURN`

The code `TCL_OK` indicates that the called function executed normally, and the caller should
continue executing normally.  

The code `TCL_ERROR` indicates that the function detected an error. The caller should (unless
it wishes to catch the error) just return `TCL_ERROR` itself, propagating the error upward.

The codes `TCL_BREAK` and `TCL_CONTINUE` are used by Tcl's loop control structures. They are
produced by the Tcl `break` and `continue` commands, which as you might expect are used to
break loop execution or jump to the beginning of the next loop iteration.  The caller should
propagate them upwardâ€”unless it's the function implementing the loop, in which case it should
catch and handle them.

The code `TCL_RETURN` is similar; it's produced by Tcl's `return` command, which is used to
return from Tcl procedures.  As with `TCL_BREAK` and `TCL_CONTINUE`, it propagates upward
until it is handled by the C function that executes Tcl procedures.

Thus, you see a lot of C code that looks like this;

```c
int result_code = Tcl_SomeFunction(interp, /* some args*/);

if (result_code != TCL_OK) {
    return result_code;
}
```

or

```c
char* value = Tcl_FindSomethingOrOther(interp, /* some args */);

if (value == null) {
    return TCL_ERROR;
}
```

But what about the Tcl procedure's computed return value?  In the `TCL_ERROR` case, just shown,
what about the error information?

The codes `TCL_OK` and `TCL_RETURN` always include a computed value (which may be the empty
string); and `TCL_ERROR` always includes an error message and some other data.  These things are
given to the `Tcl_Interp` object, represented above by the `interp` argument, as the interpreter's
_result_.  The `Tcl_Interp` class has a detailed API for setting, manipulating, and retrieving
the _result_.

## Rustifying Tcl Results

The above pattern should look pretty familiar.  It's basically the `Result<T,E>` pattern.  The
integer result codes take the place of `Ok` and `Err`, and the additional data passed via the
Tcl `interp` take the place of the `Ok` and `Err` tuple data.  Oh, and a whole lot of `if`
statements stand in for Rust's `?` operator.

Molt does it like this:

```rust
pub type MoltResult = Result<Value, ResultCode>;

#[derive(Eq, PartialEq, Clone, Debug)]
pub enum ResultCode {
    Error(Value),
    Return(Value),
    Break,
    Continue,
}
```

The `Value` type is Molt's standard representation for a data value, i.e., something that can be
put in a Molt variable.  I plan to write a post about `Value`, but for now if you think of it
as an immutable string you won't go far wrong.

A method or function in Molt's Rust API that computes a Molt `Value` returns `MoltResult`.
`Ok(Value)` handles the normal case, and corresponds to `TCL_OK`.  The four `ResultCode`
case correspond to the other Standard Tcl return codes, but don't require the interpreter's
help in passing back values.  Instead of `TCL_ERROR` we have `Err(ResultCode::Error(Value))`;
the `Value` is the error message.  Instead of `TCL_RETURN` we have
`Err(ResultCode::Return(Value))`, where the `Value` is the returned result.

In cases where we are computing something other than a `Value`, say an `i64`, we use that
directly, and return `Result<i64,ResultCode>`.

Consequently, we end up writing code like this:

```rust
let value: Value = interp.eval("some Molt code")?;

let index:i64 = molt_find_something(/* some args*)?;
...
```

Note that the Molt interpreter need not be involved!

## Tcl Liens

There are still a few things that the Standard Tcl implementation can do that Molt's
cannot.  

At present, on error Molt only returns an error message.  Tcl also saves an error code and
accumulates a stack trace as the stack unwinds.  The `ResultCode::Error` case needs to be
updated to handle that.

Also, Tcl extensions written in C do not need to confine themselves to the five canonical
result codes.  An extension that implements application-specific control structures, for example,
could use additional integer codes for own its own use.  That's more difficult with Molt's
architecture; I'd need to add an additional case to the `ResultCode` enum to support it.
