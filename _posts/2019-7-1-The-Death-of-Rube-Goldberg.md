title: The Death of Rube Goldberg
---

I began learning the Rust programming language late in 2018, and as an old C programmer was
immediately impressed by how much simpler and easier it is to configure a project in Rust.
Then I began working on [Molt](https://github.com/wduquette/molt), a Tcl interpreter written
in Rust rather than C.  I plan to use this blog to describe Molt and its implementation.
